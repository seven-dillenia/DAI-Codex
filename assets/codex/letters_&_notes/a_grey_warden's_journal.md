We searched the area but found no sign.If he was here, it was some time ago.
The fishermen in this area are friendly.Unlike some, they remember how the Grey Wardens fought to save Ferelden in the last Blight.Though they had little, they shared some of their catch to give us a better supper than we had tasted in weeks.They even deferred to me once they saw that I commanded the other Wardens, and there are few even in Ferelden who would watch an elf command men without pause.
They are friendly folk.After all this land has suffered in the past years, I hope they find some peace
Still no trace of him, though I feel the darkspawn in the ground below.Could he be lurking close to them, perhaps preparing to die with honor?I doubt it, but it is the only lead we have so far.I confess that this seems a fool's errand at times, given how much is at stake.
We saw bandits harassing the fishermen, and we intervened.The fishermen thanked us, though I fear the bandits will return again in greater numbers, and we will not always be here to help.Nevertheless, as long as we are here, the fishermen are safe.
The dreams continue, as they do every night.They make it hard for us to sleep, but we must persist.Hopefully the others will have found a solution by the time we return.In the meantime, I sing the song of Andruil to myself to clear my mind as best I can.
I grow more convinced that if he was ever here, he is now long gone.Still, it would not do for us to miss him through laziness, and he was one of our most skilled warriors.If anyone could hide himself here, it would be he.
One of the fishermen shows promise with a spear and has shoulders like an ox from throwing nets all day.He asked about joining the Grey Wardens.Under other circumstances, I would be honored to take a worthy and willing volunteer.Now... my orders did not say whether I should seek new recruits, even with our circumstances.Or because of them, I suppose.It did not hurt his cause that he was easy to look at, and clearly wished to know more about the Dalish.
The darkspawn are louder than I thought at first.The constant whisper at the back of my mind makes it difficult to sense them as easily as I usually do, but they are near the surface.Perhaps bandits are not the worst these people have to face.
He is not here.We have searched thoroughly, and we will now move on.How many days have I wasted here, with whispers lurking at the back of my mind, on this mad assignment?I pray we have more luck as we head south.
After speaking with the other Wardens, I told the fishermen about the darkspawn we sensed beneath the earth.They may not burst forth from the ground today or tomorrow, but I fear it will not be long... and we will not be here when they finally surface.The fishermen were grieved at the news, but they decided to make for West Hill, which is safe for now.
As for the fisherman who was interested in joining, I convinced him that now was not the time.Others might have told him otherwise, but he is too young to make such a sacrifice simply because he does not wish to throw nets into the water all his life.We shared one last night by the campfire, and he went on his way with a smile, humming the song of Andruil as he left.
