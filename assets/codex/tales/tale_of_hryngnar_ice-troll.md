landmark on top of a rock formation in Lady's Rest (must be allowed to borrow the boat first)landmark on wall east of River Camplandmark on Cloudcap Lake, east of Basin Floor CampTremble at the ice-troll Hryngnar, guard your gaze against his wrath,
Dead to dreams as dwarves below us, fools in folly block his path.
Weapons weeping, Avvar warriors struck to seek their legend-mark,
Fed not fortune but the Lady, folly-fallen in the dark,
Dead to Hryngnar's fury freezing.
Came the giants, water-wading, here to hunt and harrow home.
Avvar fear the shapes in shoreline, forced to flee when giants roam.
Hryngnar, ice-troll, sees his brothers, calls the winter winds to shore,
Giants frozen, forged in frostbite, threaten Avvar homes no more.
Fears of giant-battle easing.
Came the warriors of Tevinter, armors shining, shields of gold,
Stole the land of Avvar keeping, stone-carved walls to claim their hold.
Hryngnar, ice-troll, wreaks his raging, lowland warriors weep and shake,
Glacier-strength did Hryngnar conjure, stone Tevinter walls to break,
Lowlands flee, their lands releasing.
Stay unseen from ice-troll Hryngnar, glacier-strength in giant form,
None but fools will fight the winter, battle-bond the icy storm.
Dead to dreams as dwarves below us, wrath of frost and winter's death,
Blades are blunted, battle-broke, on hide whose chill can frost the breath.
Hryngnar ice-troll, winter's seizing.
