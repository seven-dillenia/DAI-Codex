"A land filled with wonders like the Merdaine, with its gigantic white statue of Our Lady carved into its face, her hands outstretched and bearing an eternal flame." Genitivi's words, brief as they were, inspired me. This stone prophet sounded magnificent. I had to see her for myself.I trekked up the Imperial Highway, concealing my identity and taking care not to seem like a foreigner. At Vol Dorma, a neglected road led west. Soon the dry land gave way to absolute desolation. Red earth. Bones. Blowing sand stripped my face raw. When it cleared, I could see for miles──not that there was anything to see. The few settlements I encountered were populated with derelicts and Chantry zealots. The warned me of worse trials, should I continue to the Merdaine.Eventually I turned back, opting for a smaller statue in a place the Maker hadn't abandoned.─Brother Berard, Perendale Chantry cleric
