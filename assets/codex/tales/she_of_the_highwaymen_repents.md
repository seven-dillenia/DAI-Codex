Gallows master, hold thy hand, hold it back awhile.
Callous juror, let me stand, let me bear a smile.For comes my brother distant,
For comes by savior soon.
I stand here most insistent,
I will receive my boon.Fellow soldier, hold thy voice, hold it if you may.
Fallow shoulders show my choice, I am in your sway.For know my crime was cruel,
And all my pain deserved.
I stand here as a fool,
Despite my brother served.Mother dearest, look away, look into the sun.
Other's nearest, gone astray, you will be undone.For no more will I prattle,
And no more will I pray.
Hear you must the rattle,
As life will fly away.
