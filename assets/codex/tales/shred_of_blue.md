Hear the rain upon the leaves, above the sky lies grey.
A shred of blue would be denied. Alas, he could not stay.
There was a stir within his blood
And the dreams lay thick upon him.
A call did beat within his heart.
One road was left before him.
Hear the rain upon the leaves, above the sky lies grey.
A shred of blue would be denied. Alas, he could not stay.
"See how the rain has washed away
The tears that you were crying?
Though the darkness calls me down
You know we all are dying."
Hear the rain upon the leaves, above the sky lies grey.
A shred of blue would be denied. Alas, he could not stay.
And so he came upon the place
Where so many tread before.
One last look upon the world
Before he crossed that final door.
Hear the rain upon the leaves, above the sky lies grey.
A shred of blue would be denied. Alas, he could not stay.
Birds reel across the endless sky, above a house upon the plain.
In memory she sings to him of a time before the rain.
Sweet Andraste, hear our song
For his road will be ours too.
Before darkness claims our souls
Let us see that shred of blue.
Hear the rain upon the leaves, above the sky lies grey.
A shred of blue would be denied. Alas, he could not stay.
