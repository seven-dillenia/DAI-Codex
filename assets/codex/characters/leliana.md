She has many names. Most know her as "Sister Leliana" or "the Nightingale." Some refuse to speak her name at all, referring to her only as the Left Hand of the Divine—the shadow behind the Sunburst Throne.

The spymaster Marjolaine trained Leliana from a young age. For years, Leliana was Marjolaine's instrument in the Great Game of Orlais. While Leliana was devoted to Marjolaine, the reverse was not true. Marjolaine betrayed Leliana and almost succeeded in killing her. Leliana survived the betrayal, thanks to Revered Mother Dorothea.

Following this betrayal, Leliana spent several years in a cloister in Ferelden, hiding from her past. Inspired by Revered Mother Dorothea, Leliana dedicated herself to her faith, discovering peace in a simple life of devotion. But when the Fifth Blight began, she received what she believed a vision from the Maker. This prompted her to leave her sanctuary, taking up arms against the darkspawn.

Several years after the defeat of the Archdemon, Leliana received a summons from Dorothea—now Divine Justinia V. She returned to Orlais to become an agent of the Sunburst Throne.

Justinia perished in the explosion that destroyed the Divine Conclave, and Leliana became a founding member and spymaster of the new Inquisition.

<h3> If Leliana is chosen as the new Divine at the end of Inquisition: </h3>

After the defeat of Corypheus and the sealing of the Breach, the Chantry chose Leliana to be the new Divine. Divine Victoria, as she will be named, will oversee the birth of a new Chantry, one that she hopes will unite all the peoples of Thedas.
