Lady Mantillon,

I can offer no apology for my nephew's behavior the other night. Gaspard has never betrayed any interest in following my advice. In truth, everything he said to you at your dinner party, he has also said to me. His resentment at being deprived of the throne has festered for some time, and he was never one to accept defeat gracefully.

I would take Gaspard's threats of war seriously. I do not believe my nephew knows how to solve problems through the use of anything but steel; if his record on the battlefield is any indication, he is quite adept at so doing. I shall be increasing my personal guard directly.

Sincerely,
Duke Gratien
