As you know from the terrible accidents of last week, many passages through the mountain are unstable and liable to collapse at any moment. I do not wish us to lose more brothers and sisters in the search for "lost cultist treasure."
We must seal all entrances into the mountain. The templars have done a careful sweep of the caves; everything of worth was collected. What remains of the Disciples of Andraste will be forgotten, buried in the earth. Once it is done, let us have no more talk of them. This is a new Haven, restored to life by the true Chantry, and Most Holy Justinia V.
