An inscription taken at the temple doors in the Forbidden Oasis, followed by a translation. The writing is shaky and uneven, as though the writer labored to complete the task:Emma solas him var din'an. Tel garas solasan. Melana en athim las enaste.Arrogance became our end. Come not to a prideful place. Now let humility grant favor.
