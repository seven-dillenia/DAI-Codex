The most powerful demons yet encountered are the pride demons, perhaps because they, among all their kind, most resemble men; as clever and manipulative as the desire demon, with a penchant for cruel irony that is almost human.

Humble men forget themselves. Jealous men fear themselves. They turn corruption and ruin into an art.
