From "Of Granting Death: Blades and Other Means."Heir's words make one passage stand out:
You misunderstand the point of secrecy.Of course they knew that I was there—one of their number was dead.It is never the aim that they are ignorant to my purpose or presence.Death is, after all, a message, and messages are meant to be received.It is paramount that the arrival remain secret, not the result.They know what may come, but never when—until the answer is "now" and there is naught they can do but receive.
A treatise on cutting edges and other debilitating elements follows.
