An illuminated copy of the Chant of Light. A few of the passages have been bookmarked:
In secret they worked
Magic upon magic
All their power and all their vanity
They turned against the Veil
Until at last, it gave way.Above them, a river of Light,
Before them the throne of Heaven, waiting,
Beneath their feet
The footprints of the Maker,
And all around them echoed a vast
Silence.
—Canticle of Threnodies 8:2-3
