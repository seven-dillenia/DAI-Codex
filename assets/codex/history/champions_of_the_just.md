Blessed are they who stand beforeThe corrupt and the wicked and do not falter.Blessed are the peacekeepers, the champions of the just.
Blessed are the righteous, the lights in the shadow.In their blood the Maker's will is written.
—Canticle of Benedictions 4:10-11When Andraste preached these verses, she offered her followers a path of virtue."In their blood the Maker's will is written" is usually interpreted to mean sacrificing one's life for a righteous cause, but like most of the Chant, deeper meaning hides beneath the surface."In their blood" can be understood as a reference to continuity, an unbroken line of humble behavior required to please the Maker.
Rather than a physical fight against demon or apostate, Andraste meant this verse as a warning that her faithful should judge their heart's intentions, questioning those who would lead them astray.Champions of the Just are those with the courage to admit their wrongdoing, while letting none continue in their sight.
Unsurprisingly, the Fourth Stanza is popular among militant branches of the Chantry, such as the knights-enchanter and the Templar Order.
